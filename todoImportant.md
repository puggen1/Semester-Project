remember to fix form on modal is full width (try clicking outside)

countdown: show only days when over a certain amout,

make countdown change every second but not if too much time and minutes dont show, only hours and days.

fonts must be linked

minor fixes to single listing: current bid, bid section, text size bigger screens, whole size bigger screend?
shadow? border? background?

change createlisting form to have on click button instead of submit... this is because i need the enter function for add image?

carousel works, but not so well with one or none pictures so have to fix that-
carousel height need fixing also

make new listing img and tag same function

for gh pages to work, i have to either run node modules or link cdn for bootstrap js
^ can change link in actions

create listing, when successfull, give message, and after a while redirect to listing?

modal creation can be single template
